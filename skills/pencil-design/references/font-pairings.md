# Font pairings

A library of 30+ typography *recipe pairings* the agent picks from when starting greenfield. Each entry names the fonts (and their source: Google Fonts, Vercel Geist, GitHub Mona Sans, or commercial foundries) and the weights to ship. The agent picks once, commits the choice to `design-system/tokens.md` and the `.pen` file's `variables`, then references font tokens (`$fontBody`, `$fontMono`) in every subsequent design.

**What this file owns:** named font-pairing recipes with mood, industry fit, anti-pattern, real-world exemplar, weights to ship, and licensing/source notes.

**What this file does NOT own:** the project's *committed* type scale. That lives in `design-system/tokens.md` (project-owned, version-controlled) and in the `.pen` file's `variables` section (the live design's typography). Typography rules (tabular numerics, text-wrap balance, optical sizing) are in `SKILL.md` § Aesthetic defaults: Typography. Letter-spacing and tracking discipline is in [`iteration-patterns.md`](iteration-patterns.md) § Failure mode: doesn't feel premium.

## When to load this file

- The agent is starting a greenfield design and the project has no committed type pairing yet.
- The user names a typeface ('use Söhne', 'something like Linear's type') or a mood ('editorial', 'developer-tool feel').
- The agent is following [`example-style-selection.md`](../examples/example-style-selection.md) (Phase 4) and needs to pick the font half of the style + palette + font triple.
- The user wants alternatives to a specific font that's commercial-only.

## How this catalogue works (architecture)

Three layers; the catalogue sits at the top.

1. **This file (`references/font-pairings.md`)** is a *menu of starting recipes*. Each recipe names a font pairing with weights and sources. The recipes don't hold the project's typography; they're the starting point.
2. **The source services** ship the actual font files. Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com), Vercel Geist (https://vercel.com/font), GitHub Mona Sans (https://github.com/mona-sans), and the commercial foundries listed per recipe.
3. **`design-system/tokens.md`** records the project's *committed* type scale. The agent records the chosen pairing here as semantic tokens (`$fontDisplay`, `$fontBody`, `$fontMono`, plus weight, size, and line-height scales). This file is project-owned; the user can edit it.
4. **The `.pen` file's `variables` section** is the live design's typography. The agent calls `SetVariables` inside `batch_design` to populate the variables from the project's `tokens.md`. Designs reference `$fontBody`, `$fontMono`, never literal font names.

The rule: **the agent reads this catalogue once at the start of a project, then never again.** Subsequent designs reference the project's variables. If the user wants to change typography, they edit `tokens.md` and the `.pen` variables; this catalogue stays untouched.

## Workflow (greenfield)

1. Identify the project's mood and industry from the brief, or ask the user.
2. Cross-check with the chosen style from [`style-catalogue.md`](style-catalogue.md). A Brutalist project doesn't get Editorial Serif; a Swiss / International project doesn't get Memphis-style display fonts.
3. Pick a pairing from the matching family below.
4. Lift the font URLs from the source service (Google Fonts CDN or self-host) into the project's HTML head.
5. Populate `design-system/tokens.md` with the chosen pairing as semantic tokens (`$fontDisplay`, `$fontBody`, `$fontMono`) plus the weight scale.
6. Call `SetVariables` inside `batch_design` to mirror the type tokens into the `.pen` file's `variables` section.
7. Record the chosen pairing recipe name in `design-system/visual-style.md`.
8. From this point onward, design with `$fontBody`, `$fontMono`, etc. Never hard-code font names in `batch_design`.

## Pairing entries

Each entry covers: **Pairing** / **Mood** / **Heading + body weights** / **When to use** / **Anti-pattern** / **Exemplar** / **Source**.

## Sans + Mono (developer tools, technical SaaS)

| Kids / education | Patrick Hand + DM Sans (display only) | Caveat + Inter (display only) |

## Picking a pairing

A few decision shortcuts:

- **Don't know? Default to Inter + JetBrains Mono.** It's the safe choice; if the design needs more personality later, swap the heading typeface and keep the body.
- **The brand has personality.** Pick from Display + Sans, Serif + Sans, or one of the casual/hand-drawn pairings.
- **The product is for developers.** Lean toward Geist or IBM Plex; keep mono visible.
- **The brand budget supports commercial fonts.** Söhne, Recoleta, GT Sectra, Migra, Alpino, Editorial New are top-tier choices that meaningfully shift the design.
- **The brand budget is zero.** Stay in Google Fonts. Inter, Geist, Fraunces, Söhne alternatives (Mona Sans), and IBM Plex cover most needs.

When the agent isn't sure, surface 2 to 3 candidate pairings. *'I think Inter + JetBrains Mono (default modern), Fraunces + Manrope (more editorial), or Geist + Geist Mono (more dev-tool). Which feels closer?'*

## Loading fonts (performance-aware)

Per [`performance-design.md`](performance-design.md) § Font loading:

- Preload critical fonts: `<link rel="preload" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>`.
- Use `font-display: swap` for non-critical.
- Subset to the actual character range (latin or latin-ext for English; smaller subsets save 30%+).
- Self-host where possible. Google Fonts' CSS file is render-blocking by default.

A typical project ships 2 to 4 weights total per typeface (e.g., Inter 400, 500, 600, 700). Variable fonts collapse this to one file.

## Pencil expression

A chosen pairing maps to the project's `tokens.md` type scale and the document's `themes.font` axis. Example:

1. Agent picks 'Inter + JetBrains Mono' from the SaaS section.
2. Agent calls `SetVariables` inside `batch_design` to populate the project's type tokens:
   - `$fontDisplay`: 'Inter', sans-serif
   - `$fontBody`: 'Inter', sans-serif
   - `$fontMono`: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace
   - `$fontWeightRegular`: 400
   - `$fontWeightMedium`: 500
   - `$fontWeightSemiBold`: 600
   - `$fontWeightBold`: 700
3. Agent records the chosen pairing in `design-system/visual-style.md`: *'Type pairing: Inter + JetBrains Mono. Source: Google Fonts. Weights: 400, 500, 600, 700 for Inter; 400, 500 for JetBrains Mono.'*
4. Agent records the type scale in `design-system/tokens.md`: text size scale with line-heights and weight defaults per scale step.

For the worked example, see [`example-style-selection.md`](../examples/example-style-selection.md) (Phase 4).

## Anti-patterns

- **Hard-coding font names from this catalogue into `batch_design`.** This file is a menu of recipes, not a source of values. Font names belong in `design-system/tokens.md` and the `.pen` file's `variables` (as `$fontBody`, `$fontMono`, `$fontDisplay`). Designs reference tokens.
- **Three or more typefaces in one design.** A serif heading + sans body + display accent + mono code is on the edge. A fifth typeface tips into chaos. Stick to a maximum of three (heading + body + mono).
- **Display fonts at body sizes.** Display fonts have wide x-heights, dramatic curves, and tight defaults. They're exhausting to read at 16px. Restrict display fonts to headings.
- **Mono fonts at body sizes.** Same problem in the opposite direction. Mono is slow to read. Restrict to code blocks, IDs, and tabular numerics.
- **Inter on every site.** Inter is the safest choice and the AI default. If the design needs personality, swap the heading font (keep Inter for body) or swap the whole pairing.
- **Commercial fonts shipped without licensing.** Söhne, Recoleta, GT Sectra, Migra are commercial. Verify the licence before shipping; or use the suggested free alternatives.
- **Variable font axis settings as decoration.** Using Bricolage's optical-size axis just because it's available reads as gimmicky. The axis settings should serve a purpose (display sizes get larger optical-size; body gets the default).
